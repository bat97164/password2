    == Retrieving a Push

    Retrieves a push and its payload. If the push is active, this request will count as a view and be logged in the audit log.

    === Security Features

    * Passphrase protection - Requires a passphrase to view.

      Provide the passphrase as a GET parameter: ?passphrase=xxx

    === Example Request

      curl -X GET \\
        -H "Authorization: Bearer MyAPIToken" \\
        https://pwpush.com/p/fk27vnslkd.json

    == Creating a New Push

    Creates a new push (secret URL) containing the provided payload.

    === Required Parameters

    The push must be created with a payload parameter containing the secret content.
    All other parameters are optional and will use system defaults if not specified.

    === Expiration Settings

    Pushes can be configured to expire after:

    * A number of views (expire_after_views)
    * A number of days (expire_after_days)
    * Both views and days (first trigger wins)

    === Security Options

    * Passphrase protection requires viewers to enter a secret phrase
    * Retrieval step helps prevent automated URL scanners from burning views
    * Deletable by viewer allows recipients to manually expire the push

      curl -X POST \\
        -H "Authorization: Bearer MyAPIToken" \\
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\

    == Push Audit Log Retrieval
