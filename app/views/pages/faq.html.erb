<h2 id="trust-is-a-concern-why-should-i-use-password-pusher">Trust is a concern. Why should I use Password Pusher?</h2>

<p>And rightfully so. All good security begins with healthy skepticism of all involved components.</p>

<p>Password Pusher exists as a better alternative to emailing passwords. It avoids having passwords exist in email archives in perpetuity. It does not exist as a end-all security solution.</p>

<p><strong>Password Pusher is opensource so the source can be publicly reviewed and can alternatively be run internally in your organization.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Passwords are entirely deleted from the database once they expire.</strong> Additionally, random URL tokens are generated on the fly and passwords are posted without context (what they go to).</p>

<p><em>A note for those with an interest in extreme security:</em> there is no way I can reliably prove that the opensource code is the same that runs on <a href="https://pwpush.com/">pwpush.com</a> (this is true for all sites in reality). The only thing I can provide in this respect is my public reputation on <a href="https://github.com/pglombardo">Github</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterlombardo/">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/pglombardo">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://the0x00.dev">my blog</a>. If this is a concern for you, feel free to review the code, post any questions that you may have and consider running it internally at your organization instead.</p>

<h2 id="are-there-other-ways-i-can-access-password-pusher-outside-of-a-browser">Are there other ways I can access Password Pusher outside of a browser?</h2>

<p>Absolutely.  Password Pusher has a fair number of applications and command line utilities that interface with pwpush.com or alternatively privately run instances.  See our <a href="/pages/tools">Tools &amp; Applications</a> page for more details.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-automate-my-password-distribution">Can I automate my password distribution?</h2>

<p>Yes - many users utilize either Slack or the command line to push and distribute passwords.  See our <a href="/pages/tools">Tools &amp; Applications</a> page for more details.</p>

<h2 id="how-many-requests-can-i-send-to-password-pusher">How many requests can I send to Password Pusher?</h2>

<p>There are no limits currently and I have no intention of adding any.  To minimally assure site stability, Password Pusher is configured with a rate limiter by default.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-run-my-own-version-for-my-organization">How can I run my own version for my organization?</h2>

<p>See our Installation documentation for more details.</p>

<h2 id="are-there-any-licensing-restrictions-for-me-my-company-or-my-organization">Are there any licensing restrictions for me, my company or my organization?</h2>

<p>The source code is released under the GNU General Public License v3.0 and that pretty much defines any and all limitations. There are quite a few rebranded &amp; redesigned clone sites of Password Pusher and I welcome them all.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-use-password-pusher-in-my-talkpresentationconference">Can I use Password Pusher in my talk/presentation/conference?</h2>

<p>Absolutely.  Sending me a link to the talk/presentation/conference would be appreciated so I could share it on Twitter.</p>

<h2 id="could-you-add-a-specific-feature-for-my-organization">Could you add a specific feature for my organization?</h2>

<p>Very likely.  I love to hear all ideas &amp; feedback. If you have any, please submit them to the <a href="https://github.com/pglombardo/Password Pusher">Github repository</a> and I will respond as soon as possible.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-make-money">How do you make money?</h2>

<p>I don’t. This is just a pet project I work on in my spare time built for the community. Monthly costs are $34/month for Heroku hosting and any time/effort that I’ve put in or will put in developing the tool is voluntary/donated.</p>

<p>I’ve thought about moving the site to a Digital Ocean droplet but Heroku just makes it so easy. No configuring Apache/nginx, deploy scripts, monitoring services etc…</p>

<p><strong>2021 Update</strong>:  The traffic has grown to an amount where 1 Heroku dyno no longer is sufficient. 2x professional dynos and the postgres add-on now has the project up to $59/month.</p>
