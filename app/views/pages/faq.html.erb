        <p>Password Pusher exists as a better alternative to emailing passwords.</p>

        <p><strong>Emailing passwords is inherently insecure.</strong> The greatest risks include:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Emailed passwords are usually sent with context to what they go to or can potentially be derived from email username, domain etc…</li>
          <li>Email is inherently insecure and can be intercepted at multiple points by malicious entitities.</li>
          <li>Emailed passwords live in perpetuity (read: forever) in email archives</li>
          <li>Passwords in email can be retrieved and used later on if an email account is stolen, cracked etc..</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The same risks persist when sending passwords via SMS, WhatsApp, Telegram, Chat etc…  The data can and is often perpetual and out of your control.</p>

        <p><strong>By using Password Pusher, you bypass all of this.</strong></p>

        <p>For each password posted to Password Pusher, <strong>a unique URL is generated that only you will know</strong>. Additionally, <strong>passwords expire after a predefined set of views are hit or time passed</strong>. Once expired, passwords are unequivocally deleted.</p>

        Trust is a concern. Why should I use Password Pusher?

      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>And rightfully so. All good security begins with healthy skepticism of all involved components.</p>

        <p>
          Password Pusher exists as a better alternative to emailing passwords. It avoids having passwords exist
          in email archives in perpetuity. It does not exist as a end-all security solution.
        </p>

        <p>
          <%= link_to "Password Pusher is opensource", "http://www.rubyonrails.org/", target: "_blank" %> so the
          source can be publicly reviewed and can alternatively be run internally in your organization.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Passwords are unequivocally deleted from the database once they expire.</strong>
          Additionally, random URL tokens are generated on the fly and passwords are posted without context for their use.
        </p>

        <p><em>A note for those with an interest in extreme security:</em> there is no way I can reliably prove that the opensource
        code is the same that runs on <a href="https://pwpush.com/", target="_blank">pwpush.com</a> (this is true for all sites in reality). The only
        thing I can provide in this respect is my public reputation on <a href="https://github.com/pglombardo", target="_blank">Github</a>,
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/peterlombardo/", target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/pglombardo", target="_blank">Twitter</a>
        and <a href="https://the0x00.dev", target="_blank">my blog</a>. If this is a concern for you, feel free to review the code, post any questions
        that you may have and consider <a href="https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher#-run-your-own-instance", target="_blank">
        running it internally at your organization</a> instead.</p>

          Some organizations are bound by security policies that prohibit the use of public services for sensitive
          information such as passwords.  There are even organizations that require all tools to be on private intranets without
          access to the outside world.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's for these reasons that we provide the ability (and encourage) users &amp; organizations to run private instances when needed.

        <p>I don’t. This is just a project that I work on in my spare time built for the community. Monthly costs are $34/month for Heroku hosting and any time/effort that I’ve put in or will put in developing the tool is voluntary/donated.</p>

        <p>I’ve thought about moving the site to a Digital Ocean droplet but Heroku just makes it so easy. No configuring Apache/nginx, deploy scripts, monitoring services etc…</p>

        <p><strong>2021 Update</strong>:  The <a href="https://twitter.com/pwpush/status/1390407791941201927">traffic has grown</a> to an amount where 1 Heroku dyno no longer is sufficient. 2x professional dynos and the postgres add-on now has the project up to $59/month.   Longer term I need to find a way to lower costs - maybe an eventual migrate to Digital Ocean which has <a href="https://twitter.com/pwpush/status/1376194351605383172">much better performance</a>…</p>
