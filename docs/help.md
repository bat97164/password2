I make no money from Password Pusher.  I pay the hosting fees out of pocket - **and it's absolutely my pleasure**.  I enjoy the project that only requires occasional spurts of effort and I'm always happy to help out my sysadmin/support/devops/netsec friends around the world.  

With that said, if anyone has the urge to give back to support Password Pusher, I would only request one or more of the following:

1. Share and suggest Password Pusher to colleagues and friends on social media and off
2. Follow me ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/pwpush), [Github](https://github.com/pglombardo)) and [star the Github project](https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher) (no value but it's fun to see the numbers)
3. If you're inclined, you could always contribute code, fixes, improvements or documentation [via Github](https://github.com/pglombardo/PasswordPusher).

Thank you for the support

Peter Giacomo Lombardo
