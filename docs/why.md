## What purpose does Password Pusher serve?

Password Pusher exists as a better alternative to emailing passwords.

**Emailing passwords is inherently insecure.** The greatest risks include:

* Emailed passwords are usually sent with context to what they go to or can potentially be derived from email username, domain etc...
* Email is inherently insecure and can be intercepted at multiple points by malicious entitities.
* Emailed passwords live in perpetuity (read: forever) in email archives
* Passwords in email can be retrieved and used later on if an email account is stolen, cracked etc..

The same risks persist when sending passwords via SMS, WhatsApp, Telegram, Chat etc...  The data can and is often perpetual and out of your control.

**By using Password Pusher, you bypass all of this.**

For each password posted to Password Pusher, **a unique URL is generated that only you will know**. Additionally, **passwords expire after a predefined set of views are hit or time passed**. Once expired, passwords are unequivocally deleted.
