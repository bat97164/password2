Password Pusher is an opensource application to communicate passwords over the web. Links to passwords expire after a certain number of views and/or time has passed.

Hosted at [pwpush.com](https://pwpush.com) but you can also easily run your own instance internally on Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift or on Heroku with just a few steps.
