      intro: This page is used as a helper tool to generate a random encryption key
        for self-hosted instances of Password Pusher.
      intro_2: Password Pusher encrypts sensitive data in the database.  Although
        there is a default key included, it's best practice to use your own custom
        encryption key.
      intro_3: With each refresh, this page generates a new encryption key.  You can
        use the randomly generated code below to configure your Password Pusher instance.
      note_1: If an encryption key isn't provided, a default key will be used.
      note_2: The best security for private instances of Password Pusher is to use
        your own custom encryption key although it is not required.
      note_3: The risk in using the default key is lessened if you keep your instance
        secure and your push expirations short.  e.g.  1 day/1 view versus 100 days/100
        views.
      note_4: Once a push expires, all encrypted data in that push is deleted.
      note_5: Changing an encryption key where old pushes already exist will make
        those older pushes unreadable.  In other words, the payloads will be garbled.  New
        pushes going forward will work fine.

        source by executing:'

      subtitle: Password Pusher is more than just a web application.  It has a JSON
        API that allows for a wide variety of integrations and applications.
      title: Tools, APIs, Integrations & Applications
      tools_1: Using the JSON API, various tools exist to interface with Password
        Pusher to automate password distribution.
      tools_2: We have no limits on how many passwords you can push (and have no intentions
        of adding limits) but we do have a rate limiter so the site doesn’t get taken
        down by bad scripts or bad actors.  Limit your tools to maximum 1 password
        every few seconds and you should be fine.
      tools_3: 'You can test this in your browser Javascript console by going to the
        front page of Password Pusher and enter:'
      tools_4: This API allows you to interface with Password Pusher via JSON.  This
        can be utilized by existing utilities such as curl, wget or any programming
        language.  See the examples below for some ideas.
      tools_5: See more explanation and examples in the %{github} Wiki.
