# When a Password expires, the payload is deleted but the metadata record still exists.  This
# includes information such as creation date, views, duration etc..  When the record
# was created by an anonymous user, this data is no longer needed and we delete it (we
# don't want it).
#
# If a user attempts to retrieve a secret link that doesn't exist anymore, we still show
# the standard "This secret link has expired" message.  This strategy provides two benefits:
#
# 1. It hides the fact that if a secret ever exists or not (more secure)
# 2. It allows us to delete data that we don't want
#
# This task will run through all expired and anonymous records and delete them entirely.
#
# Because of the above, expired and anonymous secret URLs still will show the same
# expiration message
#
# Note: This applies to anonymous pushes.  For logged-in user records, we don't do this
# to maintain user audit logs.
